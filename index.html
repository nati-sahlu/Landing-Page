        <p>this is a 2D game which are developed using ray-casting technique.ray-casting is a techniques that transform a limited form of data(a very simplified map or floor plan) into a 3D projection by tracing rays from the view point inot the viewing volume. Ray-casting sensation began with the release of a game, Wolfenstein 3D(iD software), in 1992. raycasting can go very fast, because only a calculation has to be done for every vertical line of the screen.</p>

In this part of the project, we have drawn a different color depending on the orientation of the walls. As you can see from the screen shoot, walls facing from one side is drawn in different collor from walls facing from the other side. some of the walls are lighter than the other. some are darker than the other walls

        <p>Our Maze Game was inspired by the timeless challenge of navigating through a labyrinth, testing both logic and problem-solving skills. Since we needed a project and didnâ€™t have an original idea at the time, we decided to take on the maze challenge, a classic problem in computer science.

            Mazes have been used in games and puzzles for centuries, and implementing one in C was an exciting opportunity to apply our programming skills. We wanted to create a program that could generate, display, and solve mazes, all while adhering to structured programming principles.
            
            Development Process & Timeline
            Project Selection: We opted for the Maze Game as our default project.
            
            Understanding Maze Algorithms: We explored different ways to generate and solve mazes, such as Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS).
            
            Coding the Logic: We wrote the game in C, focusing on efficient data structures like 2D arrays and linked lists for handling the maze grid.
            
            Testing & Debugging: We tested different maze sizes and paths to ensure the game was both functional and challenging.
            
            Final Adjustments & Deployment
            
            Portfolio & Collaboration
            This project is part of our ALX Portfolio, demonstrating our C programming skills, problem-solving abilities, and ability to complete structured projects.
